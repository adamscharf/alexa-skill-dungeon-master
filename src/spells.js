  "antimagic field": "a 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. this area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. a slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. while an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. targeted effects. spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. areas of magic. the area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. if the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. for example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. spells. any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. magic items. the properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. for example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. a magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. if a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. magical travel. teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. a portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. creatures and objects. a creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. dispel magic. spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t nullify each other.",  "arcane eye": "you create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration. you mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. the eye can look in every direction. as an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. there is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. a solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.",
   "arcane lock": "you touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. you and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. you can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes. while affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the dc to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.",
   "astral projection": "at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes) duration: special you and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the astral plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). the material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age. your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. the principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. this cord is your tether to your material body. as long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. if the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. your astral form can freely travel through the astral plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. if you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. your astral form is a separate incarnation. any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. the spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. when the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. the spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. a successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. if a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. if the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation. if you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.",
   "augury": "by casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. the dm chooses from the following possible omens: •    weal, for good results •   woe, for bad results •  weal and woe, for both good and bad results •     nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad the spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. if you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. the dm makes this roll in secret.",

   "charm person": "you attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. it must make a wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. if it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. the charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. when the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you. at higher levels. when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.",

   "commune": "you contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. you must ask your questions before the spell ends. you receive a correct answer for each question. divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. in a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the dm might offer a short phrase as an answer instead. if you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. the dm makes this roll in secret.",

   "dispel magic": "choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. for each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. the dc equals 10 + the spell’s level. on a successful check, the spell ends. at higher levels. when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.",
